            <p>
                In my final year at the University of Portsmouth, the Electrical
                and Mechanical Engineering faculty approached me with an
                exciting challenge, to develop an application for one of their
                robots. The goal was to integrate Pepper, a humanoid robot, with
                generative AI. This way, prospective students could chat with
                Pepper, and the robot could explain the university's benefits in
                a fun, futuristic, and engaging way!
            </p>

                Pepper, designed and built by Softbank Robotics, is all about
                human interaction and has a friendly, approachable look. The
                software I created for this project is an Android app that runs
                directly on Pepper's tablet, and it comes packed with three main
                features.

                    The robot acts on voice, you speak to it and it will
                    respond. Ask it a question it will use the ChatGPT API to
                    generate a response and it will speak it in a fun and human
                    way. This was done using a pre-built prompt that contains
                    its personality and extra bits of data it needs.

                    To allow conversation memory but reduce context, there are
                    chat sessions! Using a wake word and sleep word a user can
                    have long individual conversations with pepper.

                    The application is a foundation for future work. Using
                    different techniques like key word recognition you and
                    implement other features that are supported by pepper, like
                    emotion detection.
